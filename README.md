# This-is-the-world-we-built
Programmed with Java: A bare-bones pixel based life simulator

## The idea was to try and build a life simulator using nothing but Object Oriented Programming practices
I intend to develop this program further, some of the updates in sight

1.) Better Genetics. Right now it's four movements with some randomization, punishment and so on

2.) Implement a tiny particle that if a cell touches it, it is contaminated with a disease that has a 1/100 chance of spreading to the nearest Cell neighbour throughout the little particle's life cycle

3.) More nutritional diversity 

4.) More life types
