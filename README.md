Programmed with Java: A bare-bones 16-bit life simulator

## Requirements to run
```
apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

## The idea was to try and build a life simulator using Object Oriented Programming practices

### I intend to develop this program further, some of the updates in sight

### 1.) Better Genetics. Right now it's eight movements with some basic punishment and reinforcement. 

### 2.) Implement a tiny particle that if a cell touches it, it is contaminated with a disease that has a 1/100 chance of spreading to the nearest Cell neighbour throughout the little particle's life cycle

### 3.) More nutritional diversity 

### 4.) More life types

### 5.) Some kind of evolutionary process that would eventually allow the cells to create their own movements, punish and reinforce on the basis of 'acquiring nutrients' (Currently looking into the NEAT algorithm [Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies] as an approach)

### 6.) Cells should give birth to cells with their genetics at that moment as the genetic sequence for the child. This happens at a certain threshhold of time and nutrients acquired during that time
